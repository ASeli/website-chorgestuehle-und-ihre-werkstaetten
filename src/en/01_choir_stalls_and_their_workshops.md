Choir stalls were not only simple seating for the priests and monks. With their highly complex imaging systems they were also one of the most important and demanding artistic tasks in medieval cathedrals, monastic churches, and even parishes.
In recent years, research has focused primarily on iconographic questions and formal and stylistic analysis, as has the research of Misericordia International. There are very few studies dedicated to the workshops and their working conditions. Therefore this year the Misericordia International conference in Greifswald will deal with the workshop context of the choir stalls for the first time.
In addition to questions about substantive and economic mechanisms of art production the conference examines basic knowledge of craftsmanship the use of drawings and models in the production of choir stalls.

The target group of the conference includes researchers in art history, economic and technical history, image based working historians and conservators.

The venue Greifswald is chosen wisely. North Germany has a rich *choir landscape* whose research is a rewarding task. Nevertheless, despite work by relevant scientists that wealth is not well known, let alone scientifically. The colloquium will thus stimulate a reinterpretation of the liturgical furniture and provide new impulses.

MISERICORDIA INTERNATIONAL COLLOQUIUM 2016

Misericordia International is an international multidisciplinary network for broadbased research on choir stalls. Starting from the artistic design the studies dedicate to the relationship with other artistic elaborations and their proliferation in the Middle Ages and more recent times. The intensive exchange with scientists of neighbouring disciplines shows relations between subjects of investigation and creates new impetus to the exploration of the choir stalls. The basis for a scientific exchange is a bi-annual international conference.
The next colloquium takes place in Greifswald in June 2016. It focuses on the medieval artistic production and all questions related to the working practice in workshops for choir stalls. It is a common art historical method to identify a master-workshop relation by means of stylistic analysis. But there are further questions and new approaches to shed light on the artistic dynamics in medieval workshops.

The organisers particularly welcome papers that:

•	examine collaboration between carpenters, sculptors and painters during work in progress;

•	present new archival research;

•	deal with inscriptions and used typography on choir stalls;

•	answer business-related questions;

•	discuss mechanisms for the spread of new styles and techniques, e.g. marquetry, and how the innovative features were transmitted,

•	investigate the merger of regional characteristics because of migrant craftsmen;

•	illuminate the problem of art centre and periphery;

•	discuss the phenomenon monastery workshop or

•	review methodological approaches.

Also welcome are contributions regarding recent eras, as well as papers that deal with sample books and/or the phenomenon of church decorators in the late 19th century. Participants from different fields are welcome, including, but not limited to art history and technical history, material studies, restoration and conservation studies, and sociology.

The Call for Abstracts is now closed.
